    Gaming
</h2>
<p>
    &emsp;I love gaming! It's a great way to pass the time or enjoy my friends' long distance company. Whether I'm on my own exploring a new and foreign
    place or I'm are playing a high speed first-person shooter with a team of close-knit friends. Heck! I even get to fly down dirt
    roads at well in excessive of the speed of any sane person in over powered cars from the 80's in DiRT Rally 2. Gaming is a truly great way to
    have some fun and sometimes it doesn't even require an expensive computer or a console, as you can see with flash games and lighter titles like minecraft.

<h3>
    Competitive Gaming
</h3>
<p>
    &emsp;As I alluded to before with the reference to playing an FPS game with a team of close-knit friends,
    there is a strong competitive aspect to some games that deliver some real adrenaline rushes. FPS games like
    Counter Strike: Global Offensive, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, and Rainbow 6 Siege are all extremely competitive
    and have entire communities, events, and professional teams that play them for significant financial gain. There was
    even a tournament for the racing game DiRT Rally 2 that offered anyone, that won the qualifiers, accommodations to fly out to
    Birmhingham, UK to compete for the chance to win $10,000 just playing a video game. And that is just open to anyone
    that owned the game and wanted to race the qualifying rally and/or rallycross stages.

    PC Tweaking
</h2>
<p>
    &emsp;With gaming&mdash;at least on the PC&mdash;comes performance concerns. <i>Most</i> mid to high range CPUs are more
    than enough for gaming and a decent GPU most games can be run at a reasonable framerate. The problem occurs when the
    games you want to play require more power than your computer provides to run well or run well at the graphics settings
    you want them to run at. To get around this, without spending anymore money, you can always overclock your PC.
    Overclocking your CPU, GPU, RAM, and even your monitor's refresh rate can give you significant performance gains.
    In my personal experience just overclocking the RAM on my GPU gave me up to a 10% increase in frames per second.
    Then overclocking the RAM and CPU gave me about 13%-15% in synthetic benchmarks while in games I could expect a few
    more percent in framerate, especially in games that are highly CPU intensive.
