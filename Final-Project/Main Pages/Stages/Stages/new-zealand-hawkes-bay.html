            The Hawkes Bay stages are blisteringly fast, slippery, and above all beautiful. The stages are all set
            near the Hawkes Bay Coastline with the foliage to prove it. The traction on these stages is pretty good
            as far as the game goes with mostly gravel so your braking distances can be quite short but it still
            offers enough "slipperyness" to allow you to throw your car around the corners and maintain speed while
            going sideways. I personally have enjoyed these stages at ton especially since even if you go off the path
            you're getting impaled by nothing other than tropical plants and trees. But you rarely go off if you're
            any good at the game since the roads are about medium width with very few turns that will punish you for
            missing a call from your co-driver. Overall this location is amazing and tons of fun to really push your
            limits with the faster cars like B Class and even the Modern Rally GT Class.
