            Monaro is&hellip;frustrating. If you're like me and try to bomb down long the long narrow straights
            in Monaro you'll find that you are often losing control of the car at the slightest hint of a bump.
            The stages are all very slippery here and offer nothing even resembling grip. But that's not it!
            I—like everyone else—just need to slow down rather than mat it in area I really probably shouldn't
            at least until I actually get good. The worst thing is the "jump maybe" or "jump" that the co-driver calls out.
            What this call out actually means in these stages is "Bro chill for a second, you're about to go fucking flying."
            This is a hard game though and not meant for the faint of heart or those that refuse to actually learn
            from their mistakes. So, if you resist the urge to fly into the sky like you're driving the Deluxo
            from GTA V, this stage has a lot of tight corners to throw your car around and nice long straights
            to really push the limits of your ability on slippery surfaces.
