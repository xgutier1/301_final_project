            Welcome to DiRT Rally DB
        </h1>
        <p>
            I found that there was little to no DiRT Rally content knowledgebases out there for
            everyone without having to search through so many forums just to find a new tune for
            your car or how to attack that one left 2 turn right after a jump <i>"maybe"</i> that you
            always just slowed down for rather than going through it like a pro. So enjoy yourself
            learn a few new things and be wary of the dreaded "don't cut"!

            What I Am Setting Out To Do With DiRT Rally DB
        </h2>
        <p>
            This website as you can see is fairly barren. It's almost as barren as the field that I grow my fucks upon.
            I am no DiRT Rally mastermind, but some of you are. Or even if you aren't you still always have something
            interesting or important to share to the rest of the DR2 community and I...err...I mean <strong>WE</strong>
            want to hear it to get better and enjoy our game even more as the great gaming community we are. Please
            feel free to share any knowledge you have on this site as I try my best to keep it up to date. As you can
            already see it won't be perfect, but it is still better than nothing&mdash;a place for us to share our game
            knowledge and racing know how. So enjoy and be wary of the dreaded "don't cut"!
        </p>
