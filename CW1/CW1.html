    My Favorite Programming Language
</h1>
<h2>
    Types of Languages
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Low-level languages</li>
    <li>Assembly languages</li>
    <li>High-level languages</li>

<h2>
    High-Level Languages
</h2>
<p>
    When we thing about computer programmers, we are probably thinking about people who write in <b>high-level programming languages</b>.
</p>
<p>
    <b>High-level languages</b> are written in a form that is close to our human language, enabling to programmer to just focus on the problem being solved.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Examples include</i>: C, C++, Java, Pascal, Python, Visual Basic.
</p>
<h3>
    Advantages
</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Easier to modify as it uses English like statements</li>
    <li>Easier/faster to write code as it uses English like statements</li>
    <li>Easier to debug during development due to English like statements</li>
    <li>Portable code &#8211; not designed to run on just one type of machine</li>
</ol>
<p>
    My favorite programming language is Python. It is extremely versatile and and has many different libraries for it that are designed for everything from statistics and facial recognition AI to controlling development boards such as Arduino&#8482; or Adafruit&#8482; boards.
    Python is also a very high-level code that closely relates to pseudo-code. It is a ton of fun to program little text based games
    for practice or for real work like trying to find incoming security threats before they become an issue to your computer networking systems.
